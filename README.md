# Twutter

## What are we doing?

You just started a fantastic new back-end job at Twutter™, a new social media website for coders to share funny thoughts with each other. Unfortunately, the last person who had your job left furious and deleted almost all of the Express back-end! Fortunately, they left you a `package.json` and a 2 line `server.js` file.

## How to save Twutter™!

Set up an Express server with `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` routes on your `server.js`. These routes should Read, Create and Delete instances of the `Post` model in `models.js`. Get hacking!
